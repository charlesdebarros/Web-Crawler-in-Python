## A Web Crawler built in Python 3

This is a multi-threaded website crawler written in Python.

The purpose of this tool is to gather links **only**

### Running the crawler

Open ```main.py``` and edit ```HOMEPAGE``` with the website you want to craw. Replace 'http://www.bbc.co.uk/' with something else.

_Note:_ Be mindful with the website address to be used as there may be too many results and it will take a long time to run the crawler.

At the terminal, run:

```python
  python main.py
```
